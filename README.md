# COA-Take-Home-Challenge
Hello, welcome to my presentation of Code Of Africa Take-Home Challenge. This Challenge consisted of 3 Parts: Interactive Photo Gallery, Array Manipulation and String Transformation. In order to check the code you need to clone this repository to your local machine or download it as a .zip file

# Interactive Photo Gallery

Caution: If You Face any Issues Loading The Fonts It's because the browser caching problem so clean it or open the site in incognito or private tab.

# ArrayMap.Js & StringTransform.Js Challenges
For The Last two last challenges i built them as simple javascript functions to tackle them and left some comments in the code to show you the procedure but maybe if you don't find them very useful then i left u some examples down that you can play with to check the convenience of the functions.

In order to test the functions though you will need to execute them so because i found it somehow challenging to execute them without a browser i will give you a good method steps to follow in order to execute the function which are the following(using Visual Studio Code as IDE):
Step 1: Download and Install NodeJs in your Computer incase you don't have it.
Step 2: Open The Challenge .Js File in VSCode IDE or another one.
Step 3: Open the Intergrated Terminal for VSCode press Ctrl + `.
Step 4: Run the script using the node or NodeJs runtime command.

be free to change the values in example usages to test the convenience of the function.

Thank You for Letting me participate in this Code Of Africa Take Home Challenge, i learnt many new cool things in CSS and new ways to tackle my problems due to this Challenge so It was my pleasure to participate, Have a Nice One.
