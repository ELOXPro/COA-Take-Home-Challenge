# COA Take-Home Challenge

Welcome to my submission for the Code of Africa (COA) Take-Home Challenge. This challenge consists of three parts: Interactive Photo Gallery, Array Manipulation, and String Transformation. Follow the instructions below to explore the code and demos.

## Interactive Photo Gallery

## Array Manipulation and String Transformation Challenges

The last two challenges are implemented as simple JavaScript functions with comments explaining the procedure. If you find the comments insufficient, examples are provided for you to test the functions' convenience.

### How to Test the Functions

To test the functions, you'll need to execute them. Below are the steps to do so using Visual Studio Code (VSCode):

1. **Download and Install Node.js**: If you don't have Node.js installed on your computer, download and install it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Open the Challenge `.js` File**: Open the `ArrayMap.js` or `StringTransform.js` file in VSCode or another IDE of your choice.
3. **Open the Integrated Terminal in VSCode**: Press `` Ctrl + ` `` (backtick) to open the integrated terminal.
4. **Run the Script**: Execute the script using the Node.js runtime by typing `node <filename>.js` in the terminal.

Feel free to change the values in the example usages to test the functions' flexibility and performance.

## Conclusion

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the Code of Africa Take-Home Challenge. I learned many new techniques in CSS and innovative ways to approach problem-solving. It was a pleasure to participate.

Have a great day!
